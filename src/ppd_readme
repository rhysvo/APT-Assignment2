Advanced programming assignment2
Assmuptions:
	Given the highest value currency defined in the ppd_coin.h file is ten
	dollars, I found it appropriate to make ten dollars the highest denomination
	accepted by the program, either by accepting user input(money) or in file 
	reading.
	Also, given the sample executable, I assumed it was appropriate to sort the
	list by Name, but did not attempt to sort by name ignoring case. 

The Boolean type:
	To make full use of the BOOLEAN typedef made in ppd_main.h, I pulled it out,
	and made it its own header file, called bool.h. This allowed me to 
	restructure my program to avoid circular dependencies, yet be able to use 
	BOOLEAN in every file.

Possible Improvements:
	Having learned a lot(I hope) in the past month or so, I do see ways to 
	improve the general working of my program. Given the time, I would 
	implement a Genereic linked list, with the appropriate function pointers.
	I would also change the ways I add to the list, would avoid returning
	a struct ppd_node in the function load_item_file in the stock.c file. 
	Another imporvment would be to abstract a function to accept user input
	other than an integer, such as a String, and pass the maximum length, and
	a message such as the name of what data im attempting to propt the user for.

File Checking:
	When reading in the Coin file, the load_coin function ignores letters, 
	rather than exiting entirely.
